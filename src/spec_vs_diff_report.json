  "summary": "REQ-7/REQ-8/REQ-9 are largely implemented in the frontend via synced bite/chew audio playback gated by user interaction, a Surprise-view mute/unmute control, and additional animation overlays/micro-actions. However, the diff does not add the required new static media assets (the two required overlay PNGs and the referenced audio files), so the implementation appears incomplete with respect to required assets being present as frontend static files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Audio assets are loaded from frontend static files (no backend serving), with bite and chew sounds available at runtime.",
      "reason": "The code references static audio files (/assets/audio/teddy-bite.mp3 and /assets/audio/teddy-chew.mp3) but the diff shows no added files, so the required audio assets are not present in the changes provided.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/TeddyChocolateAnimation.tsx (references '/assets/audio/teddy-bite.mp3' and '/assets/audio/teddy-chew.mp3')",
        "file-diff summary: ADDED FILES: none"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Provide the required new overlay images (anime-bite-impact.dim_512x512.png and anime-chew-lines.dim_512x512.png) as frontend static assets for the enhanced animation detail.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly requires two new image assets; the diff includes state flags for bite impact and chew lines overlays but shows no added image files, so the required assets are not included in the change set.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/TeddyChocolateAnimation.tsx (adds showBiteImpact/showChewLines overlay logic)",

      "description": "Global romantic OKLCH palette and broad global CSS/theming updates beyond the animation/sound control requirements.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on adding synced sound, a mute control, and increasing animation detail while keeping the overall app flow; it does not request a global theme/palette overhaul.",
